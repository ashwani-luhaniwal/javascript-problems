/**
 * -----------------
 * Most Common Word
 * -----------------
 * Given a paragraph and a list of banned words, return the most frequent word that is not in the 
 * list of banned words. It is guaranteed there is at least one word that isnâ€™t banned, and that 
 * the answer is unique.
 * 
 * Words in the list of banned words are given in lowercase, and free of punctuation. Words in the 
 * paragraph are not case sensitive. The answer is in lowercase.
 * 
 * Note:
 *  1 <= paragraph.length <= 1000.
 *  1 <= banned.length <= 100.
 *  1 <= banned[i].length <= 10.
 * 
 * The answer is unique, and written in lowercase (even if its occurrences in paragraph may have 
 * uppercase symbols, and even if it is a proper noun.)
 * 
 * paragraph only consists of letters, spaces, or the punctuation symbols !?',;.
 * Different words in paragraph are always separated by a space.
 * There are no hyphens or hyphenated words.
 * Words only consist of letters, never apostrophes or other punctuation symbols.
 * 
 * paragraph= "Bob hit a ball, the hit BALL flew far after it was hit."
 * banned= ["hit"]
 * 
 * Steps to solve the problem
 *  1. We have to remove all special characters using the .replace() method.
 *  2. We have to convert the paragraph to lowercase using the .toLowerCase() method.
 *  3. We have to convert the paragraph to an array using .split() method
 *  4. Filter x for banned words using the .filter() method
 *  5. Count the number of repetitive words in the filtered array using .reduce() method and store 
 *      as an Object.
 *  6. Return the word with the highest value in the Object using the .reduce() method.
